# randomcatfact

## A simple Flutter app that shows you a random cat fact!

Facts are fetched from the [cat-facts API](https://github.com/alexwohlbruck/cat-facts)

## What does this app do currently?

1. Fetches the JSON file
2. Parses it to an Array
3. Takes a random fact and stores it as a String
4. Displays it in the console
5. Displays it on the UI (check for problems regarding this below)

## What about the other stuff?

I have finished the UI.

Only problem now is the fact that the fact doesn't update seamleslly on the UI.
Making a Hot Reload will update the fact.

I will fix this when I catch some free time for it.
