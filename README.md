# randomcatfact

## A simple Flutter app that shows you a random cat fact!
Facts are fetched from the [cat-facts API](https://github.com/alexwohlbruck/cat-facts)

## What does this app do currently?
1. Fetches the JSON file
2. Parses it to an Array
3. Takes the random fact
4. Displays it in the console

## What about the other stuff?
Well, currently the 'frontend' of the app looks halfdone.
